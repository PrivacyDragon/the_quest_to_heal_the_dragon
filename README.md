# the quest to heal the dragon

The quest to heal the dragon is a text adventure written in Python3 where you have to heal the dragon. The dragon has a cold and with his coughing he set the trees on fire! Your quest is to heal him.

The game is pretty straightforward in how to play. You just walk by saying stuff like 'west' or 'north', you can pick something by saying 'pick ....' and so on.

## How to start the game?

There are two binary files and the normal Python file available for this game. If you don't have Python3 installed you can try to use a binary file, for which the instructions are below, but this is at your own risk. You can also choose to use the Python file, for which the instructions are here:

### USING THE PYTHON FILE

  1. Make sure that you have Python3 installed.
  2. Open a terminal window and type: `Python3 /path/to/The-quest-to-heal-the-dragon.py`
  3. Now you should be in the game.


### USING THE BINARY FOR WINDOWS
  This is compiled on a Windows7 computer, but it _should_ also work on Windows10.

  1. Open the Command Prompt or Powershell and type: '.\path/to/The-quest-to-heal-the-dragon.exe` or just double-click the executable.
  2. Now you should be in the game.


## USING THE BINARY FOR LINUX
  This is tested on: 
   * Open Suse Leap 15.1
   * Kali Linux 2021.1 (via QEMU)
   * CentOS 7 (via QEMU)
   * Debian 10.8.0 (via QEMU)

  1. Open a terminal window and type: `chmod +x /path/to/The-quest-to-heal-the-dragon` (This command only has to be run the first time, to make the file executable)
  2. Type: `./path/to/The-quest-to-heal-the-dragon`
  3. Now you should be in the game.

When the game is exited, the progress should be saved automatically.
You can then the next time that you run the program choose for 'resume' to continue where you stopped.
